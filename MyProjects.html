      <h3>2017.9</h3>
      <p>My team built an Android app during Marta Hackathon, which helps the users to find the closest stations and shows them the schedule of the train in that station. It's an android app based on Marta and Google Maps API.</p>

      <h3>2017.10</h3>
      <p>We built this image smoothing algorithm during HackGT. To hold it, we built a website that allowed users to upload the picture and we also implemented an Azure bot in the website to offer users guidance. </p>

              <h3>2017.10</h3>
              <p>We built this website during HackATL for users to find exercise buds and make friends through different sports. Users register, filter through time slot and sport type, and then either choose to create a new issue or to join the event somebody already created.</p>
